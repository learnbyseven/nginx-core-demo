Nginx core demo

we are trying to configure the load balancer/health check for web service with https traffic however got some issue .
It is working fine with IP hash but didnâ€™t support for session persistence with session id. 
Also ssl termination is required at both NGINX and application side. 

I have sketched our requirement in below diagram. Could you help us to configure the same to complete the POC? I have attached the conf file herewith for your reference.
